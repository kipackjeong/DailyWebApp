# ToDoWebApp
 
 
 Why did I made this?
 - I like to plan/record tasks everyday and keep track of tasks that you finished or didn't finish.
 - Get a good practice of Blazor server web development.
 - A daily report feature will be added soon where you can write down the task you actually did at current time.
